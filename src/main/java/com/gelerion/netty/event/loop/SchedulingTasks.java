/*
Occasionally youâ€™ll need to schedule a task for later (deferred) or periodic execution. For example, you might want
to register a task to be fired after a client has been connected for five minutes. A common use case is to send a
heartbeat message to a remote peer to check whether the connection is still alive. If there is no response, you know
you can close the channel.
